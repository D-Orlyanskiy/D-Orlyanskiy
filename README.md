# 👋 Hi, I'm Dmitriy — iOS Engineer

I’m an iOS Engineer with 5+ years of experience building and evolving large-scale consumer and fintech applications. Currently, I work at **GoInvest**, where I develop investment features used by thousands of users daily.

My core focus is building reliable, user-friendly interfaces with **SwiftUI and UIKit**, maintaining clean architecture, and delivering features end-to-end — from requirements and implementation to release and support in production.

I have strong experience working in **product teams (Scrum)**, collaborating closely with product managers, designers, and analysts. I care about performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability of the codebase, not just shipping features.

### What I work with
- 📱 iOS: Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit
- 🧱 Architecture: MVVM, CLEAN
- 🧪 Testing & quality: unit/UI tests, code reviews
- 🤝 Product development in cross-functional teams
