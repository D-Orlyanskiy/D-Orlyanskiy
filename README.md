# 👋 Hi there, I'm Dmitriy!

I'm an iOS Developer with 4+ years of experience building mobile apps with Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit. I enjoy writing clean, modular code, improving architecture, and delivering apps that scale and perform.

In my recent role at **QIWI**, I migrated legacy UI to **SwiftUI**, modularized the codebase with **SPM**, and contributed to cross-platform features using **Kotlin Multiplatform**. I love sharing knowledge with teammates, mentoring, and exploring better development practices.

Currently focusing on:

- ⚙️ Clean architecture & MVVM
- 🧪 XCTest / XCUITest & CI/CD pipelines
- 📱 SwiftUI integration in production apps

Always open to collaboration, interesting projects, or just connecting with fellow devs. Let’s build something cool together!
